That should be good for a little drama.....lol. She has been working very very hard.  She doesn't know I'm coming up yet.

Her flight to Rome had a delay,\n,which caused her to miss her connecting flight.  It was a bit hairy for her because she said Americans just don't care about you the way Canadians do at the airport.  I had to plant my feet and refuse to move from the desk until someone addressed that I needed a new connecting flight done\". She had no way to communicate because apparently you only get a half of of \"free wifi\" in the Chicago airport.! She sorted herself out but it took her an extra six or seven hours.  Welcome to solo International travel!  She loves where she is living,she has been given a bicycle to get the children to and from school. Lol. Can't you just see it now?"

I would love to get together with you.  I wasn't aware that you have been ill. I'm sorry to hear that.  I think a coffee time is in order . I would love to fill you in on Natalie.  It's long though,.....so I think maybe we should \"get together\". I would love to pick you up on a free day, you name the afternoon that works best for you. Maybe you would like to go to Baked for a coffee?  Just let me know.  This latest little weather dump is all very discouraging , I know that those little crocuses are probably thinking \"what the f--------k???? \".  I would love to see you sometime this week. Let me know, I look forward to it.  If you don't feel able to go out ,I can bring coffee to you. I remember, coffee with milk, no sugar .....or..if you prefer -coffee with cream....no sugar!   Oh, and it's all positive on this side of the bridge.  Natalie has endured and worked hard. She now takes each day as it comes and funnily reminds me....\"Mom,some days are diamonds,and some days are stones.....\"  Gee, where did she get that wisdom from?  From a very wise teacher of hers......."

I have to avoid places with any number of people in order to avoid catching colds/flu etc.....Also energy is low and I have lots of happy responsibilities here....5 day Big Dog sitting, 2 days care-giving with Reggie plus overnights and other odd times (especially when Tiana has consult clients here in my used- to- be Music room.)...also have Jarett and his girlfriend living here after he had the latest \"good run\" re mental health...staying until new jobs appear and finances improve...also had a rescue puppy for 4 months while trying to find the perfect home for her (Bless Anne Gratton, who is now the forever puppy owner)...also had adopted a friends 2 cats and Mel and Jarett have brought 2 of theirs as well. I haven't painted lately, but the stuff is now on the table, waiting. Had a month of illness (just recovering now)....seems pretty negative when I re-read this , but it truly isn't.....I'm pretty used to reinventing my life....have done some writing as well. Would like to know just where Natalie is in her  life...could you catch me up on this? Obviously stopped teaching due to fatigue, illness and the need to avoid contact with illness. I miss some of my past activities, but it's all worth it since the true worth of my service is measured by the assistance I can give my children. Let me know how you are doing and what you are up to next......good stuff, I'm sure."
