Jen will be picking me up for work (I'll drop off the baby early) and taking me home after work (and then I'll go get the baby).  This means that mom-you don't have to take me to or from work and I've got all baby transport covered.  You just need to get the car in for 2 pm.  And Jen-don't forget me ;)"
