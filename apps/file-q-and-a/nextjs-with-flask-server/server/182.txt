Your best bet is to contact teachers who are currently teaching (I stopped a few years ago) and let them know it's available. Wish I could tell you what to ask for it, or to give it away. If you know of anyone who uses a piano, they may agree to check yours out to give you a more definitive opinion. Sorry I can't be more help/........hope you are doing well, weathering all the changes life throws at us."

The piano has never seen dampness and has been tuned up until fifteen years ago. Any suggestions what I can do? It's an old player piano with parts taken out, upright. Any info or suggestions would be helpful. Thanks Lesley."
