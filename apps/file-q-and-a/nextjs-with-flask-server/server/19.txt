I haven't heard back from the paliative care unit, but this is truly not on my screaming high alert sensor at the moment.  I think I would feel better if we all were on the same page regarding my health and the progression of the disease.    I have been doing  (with a few slips) my best to slow down the assault.  I am OK with this.  Your thoughts?"

I want you to enjoy the Pictou Island thing to the max, but feel more relaxed if I had someone closer most of the time. And, truly can't see any other way for Jare......I would not expect you to put up with my occasional dust-ups and no complaiining about him as much as possible .Lots of thought. So, it would take a load off your mind about being away WHICH YOU TRYLY DESERVE .....it's a fantastic opportunity. Anyway, I will continue to bust my chops down here, keeping on the track of my maintaining a reasonable health level.  love ys....what do you think?"

Any cost beyond the 100 can be charged to my Mastercard or debit...OR....go to Giant Tiger and purchase the above and I will give you the 100 dollar gift card and pay excess as described....Jare has an online meeting with his psychiatrist on Monday morning and Burrill in the afternoon.....he has no clothes (except a jacket) that is suitable...I will keep these hidden for \"Sunday-Go-To-Meeting\" appts.

This was the worst time for me to make any plans, to invest in any future for myself or my loved ones.  I am sure that youknow of at least a few of these but I won't go int a litany of them because what is done,is done.  Be very careful,my darling daughter....be careful that you hold on to yourself, to your soul and to your belief in yourself while considering your decision about your future endeavors.......if it is right, then it is right.  If it is wrong, then it is wrong.  Your heartstrings will tell you the truth.  Love you."

So then I had to do all in my power to lessen the stressed breathing, increased heart rate, etc......stupid, stupid, stupid ...all after he was gone from the room...it is the same with all other unexpected happenings.....makes me want to throw something through the window, make a big, horrendous noise.  yes, aging is extremely frustrating and I truly am doing my best to handle it all.  ....and I can never tell you how much I appreciate your forbearnce and loving support...thank you.",

So, whatever is being discussed must somehow find an answer to his future as well as mine....the easiest is that he goes with me wherever I go (very Biblical that), but that may not be possible, so we (you, I, Rex) must look at the options.  I don't actually care about myself, but I do care about Jare and he must be kept as safe as possible.......Love you my amazing daughter."

Any other ideas here? This would mean very little discard, moving etc. I am also going to ask Paul to get an answer from Jare re the desk and chair."

He said \"she's the worst hoarder\" and Anne said....who knows....and when I got out of the car she said. \"keep checking kijiji\"  and I responded with \"this is the same type of wardrobe that I asked you to look out for for me\"........aaaah,,,,,silence....and I also remnded her that this is the exact type of wardrobe that I had asked her to look out for for me."

Haley will be with him and will do housekeeping...she may also take the aprtment next to Jare's when her financial situation is figured out. They have the keys, Jare will be faxing the forms signed by the landlord today (two guys who live in Halifax) to Assistance and hopefully all will be a \"go\"...rent (all inclusive) is low since the building is under some govt grants re disabilities....and internet is shared at a low cost between tenants.

Given the rampant nature of the SilverLace vine....it would take less plants to cover the area....but it makes sense to fill in the between spaces with annuals, such as scarlet runner beans.  If not, other perennials would be: honeysuckle, clematis (have recommendations here, since some bloom earlier than others, some bloom on old wood, some on new...pruning comes into play here)....we'll talk...most important is to plant the major one...I recommend Silver Lace Vine ( will look and approx how many)...you should contact nurseries to see if they have any or can bring in enough...Info soon re how many.",

AUTUMN WAS NOT HURT....traumatized as was I...I had the cord of the leash wrapped around my right index finger and when Autumn took off to run from the attacker, the leash cord tightebned and burnt my finger...I let go, cause there was nothing else I could do to hold her back...It was shortlived, but awfully scary...the dog took off around the house and Autumn and I made it into the porch...It was heart-stopping...Roger came bounding downstairs having heard the commotion and that poor woman was also here to check on Autumn and myself...My heart has just now stopped racing and thumping...It could have been far worse.  Just my finger suffered......crappola. They are moving by the way,...this weekend.

Will take it back to the yard if I recuperate. lol Going to rest and then see if I have the energy to pick up poop. If weather is nice tomorrow, I will do some stuff with the side yard....Tiana, those trees are severely sick. Does Jay Fulton remove these kind of trees? There are two goodish maples and those two trees I paid attention to in the spring....the rest should be killed. I know I am talking money here, but maybe there is another way? We will lose our privacy, but we aint sunbathing in the nude out there, are we?  Hope your day is going well."

Nothing earlier today cause it's Jare's birthday.  I wasn't sure I was going to mention it at all but this is the 2nd night I'm lying in bed thinking about it. Part of me wants to back off asking for/accepting help. I don't want to be a burden. And I certainly never want her to be a burden either.   Anyway, there it is. I know you weren't feeling great that night and I shouldn't have asked in the first place. Was just excited at the prospect of having a bunch of friends in the same place to hang out with for a bit.
