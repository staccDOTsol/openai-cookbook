I'm contacting you with regards to a Community Expo that the Pictou Elementary home & school are putting on June 5th from 5-8pm at the school.  The purpose of the expo is to highlight the activities that are available for children in the community to participate in such as sports, dance, music, guides, 4-H, art, etc.  It is free for both exhibitors and visitors.  If you would be interested in having a table at the expo to speak to kids and their parents about your voice and piano lessons, please let me know and I will send you some more info and a short form to fill out.  Thanks Lesley...hope you are well!"
