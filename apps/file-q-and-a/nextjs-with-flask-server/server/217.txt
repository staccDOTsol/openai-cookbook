I am OK, now hooked into the paliative care unit so a lot more is helpful in so many ways, and the object is to stay at home as long as possible....but since COPD is (for a while at stage 4) all remains to be seen....heat was hellish, but the heat pump's AC was awesome.  Having to give up on any plantings from Vesey's or trips to Garden Centers.....so no  outdoor hanging planters (too hot anyway), no new plantings and deriving a small garden that tends itself.....the star is Candy-Oh rose bush....loverly.....last two weeks hve been a tad overwhemling with a week visit from the oldest boy, a brief visit from daughter-in-law and 2 grand girls, VON nurses, Continuing care, friends, etc.....looking forward to a week of children in school (for however long that transpires), Tiana back to work and Viki (living upstairs with Tiana and her daughter Luna) plus another big dog, cats, and a miniature pig.!!!!!My oldest will be taking more weekends to fly in to visit. My health is a tad better now wifth additional meds....and great stuff from Paliative Care....take good care and could I buy (etransfer) some fall flowers for a vase????"

Haven't decided what I'm doing with Adreanna fir school yet. I am taking her out of French Immersion. She had 4 month of home studying in English. I fear with a second wave she\"ll fall even further behind. So we decided to put her in english. At least if I decide to keep her home or school closes again, I will be able to help her. Couldnt with the friench. Hope you are feeling good and doing well. Think of you often. Take care."
