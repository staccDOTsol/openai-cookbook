Brunch is provided so don't worry about food. \n\nWe will hand out the shirts that morning to everyone so we all look the same for the photo. You can wear whatever you want for the bottoms, pants, shorts, jeans.\n\nIt shouldn't take very long as long as we show up on time. The Texas contingent has to be done and out the door by 11 as we have to prepare for my moms 80th birthday celebration we are hosting that afternoon at 2, if you wanted to stay you are more than welcome.\n\nI will send this by email as well as some are not facebookers\n\nJulia and Cameron"
