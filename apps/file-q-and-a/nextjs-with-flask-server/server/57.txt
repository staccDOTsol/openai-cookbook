Still teaching (but winding down the number of students) and moved to New Glasgow a year and a half ago.....lovely older home with my flat downstairs and my daughter Tiana has the upper two floors...completely separate. I have a Music Room (so nice). Tiana has a lovely little babe (Reggie, after her grandfather) who is two months old...terrific to have her so near and spend lots of time with her....they sure change your life completely, yes? I keep up with you on fb so keep those pictures coming of you and Lily!!!!  Take care. And thanks for the message..it sure perked me up."

Thinking about the piano of course makes me think of you and I miss our lessons together! It's been so long!\n\nI really hope I don't lose too much of what I've learned as I want to teach Lily (my daughter) how to play too!\n\nAnyways I just thought I'd say hi and let you know I was thinking of you! I hope all is well :)\n\n- Katie"
