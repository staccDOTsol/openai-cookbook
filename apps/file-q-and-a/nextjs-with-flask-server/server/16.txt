Nice to have a music room and I also have David Henderson's old piano which always brings back so many memories. The keys keep popping off due to all the moves it's made!!!!\nI do miss Anna as well....one of my brightest spots every week.\nWish her all the best for me in the musical and with school/guitar. You must be looking forward to Pictou Island!!!!!!\nKeep well and safe.  Always up for a visit here (59 Mackay St).!!   755-6759."
