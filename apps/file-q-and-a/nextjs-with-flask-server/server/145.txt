She has an upright piano that she is unable to move with her.  It is a Nordheimer and she said it was been service and tuned over the years by Dan Friessan.  She would like to get $100-$150 for it, but I believe that she would give it away if there was a piano player/student in need.  I told her I would put some feelers out.\n\nSo if this is of interest, please be in touch and I can put you in touch with her.\n\n\nThanks\n\nMary-Beth\n"
