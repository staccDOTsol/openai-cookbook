The best med combo that you can get is a fast acting bronchodilator- (Ventolin), combine with a LAMA- (Spiriva) and a LABA-ICS ( Advair or Symbicort)  that said the Spiriva and Atrovent are essentially the same drug only difference is how long they last, Atrovent is 6 hours and Spiriva is 24 hours.   The studies show Spiriva is better but some people have found they didn't like it and want the atrovent back, the Spiriva is better but not so much so I wouldn't make the change if the person had a complaint.  The Symbicort and Spiriva are different in that Symbicoct has a 12 hour bronchodilator AND steroind, the Spiriva is a 24 hour bronchodilator. Think of the two different bronchodilators as the divided highway verses the old highway....they get you to the same place but take different routes to get there.  We call them synergistic because they work well together.  I'll call you from work tomorrow."
